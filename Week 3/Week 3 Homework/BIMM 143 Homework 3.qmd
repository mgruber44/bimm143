### Q6. How would you generalize the original code above to work with any set of input protein structures?

First, we have to load in the library using `library(bio3d)`. After that, we can begin working with the code.

```{r}
#This code generates an analysis of protein drug interactions by plotting the B factor (low B-factor values indicate a part of a structure that is well ordered, while large B-factor values indicate more flexibile parts of the structure) and residue values. It generates a graph that allows for one to visualize these values.

#first, we assign a protein of interest to object sX
sX <- read.pdb("protein")

#next, we trim the PDB entry to only include the variables we are interested in plotting for these protein structures. This is the chain and elety entries from object sX - we apply this to another object to specificy this trimming
sX.chainA <- trim.pdb(sX, chain="A", elety="CA")

#finally, we plot the trimmed PDB protein structure on a graph, with the x-axis showing the residue and using ylab to rename the y-axis to 'Bfactor'. Sse computes the sum of squared differences of the trimmed PDB protein structure data
plotb3(sX.chainA$atom$b, sse=sX.chainA, typ="l", ylab="Bfactor")

#For example:

sX <- read.pdb("8I8Y")
sX.chainA <- trim.pdb(sX, chain="A", elety="CA")
plotb3(sX.chainA$atom$b, sse=sX.chainA, typ="l", ylab="Bfactor")

sX <- read.pdb("7XM8")
sX.chainA <- trim.pdb(sX, chain="A", elety="CA")
plotb3(sX.chainA$atom$b, sse=sX.chainA, typ="l", ylab="Bfactor")
```
