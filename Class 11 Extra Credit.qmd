# **Section 4: Population Scale Analysis**

### Q13: Read this file into R and determine the sample size for each genotype and their corresponding median expression levels for each of these genotypes

```{r}
genodata <- read.table("datafile.txt")

summary(genodata)

table(genodata$geno)
```

```{r}
AA <- genodata$exp[genodata$geno == "A/A"]
AG <- genodata$exp[genodata$geno == "A/G"]
GG <- genodata$exp[genodata$geno == "G/G"]

median(AA)
median(AG)
median(GG)
```

The median values for A/A, A/G, and G/G genotypes are 31.248, 25.065, and 20.073, respectively.
						

### **Q14**: Generate a boxplot with a box per genotype, what could you infer from the relative expression of ORMDL3?

```{r}
boxplot(AA, AG, GG)
```

Yes, the SNP does affect the expression of ORMDL3, with A/A having the highest expression value followed by A/G and then G/G, respectively.
